## Project Overview

In this project, I created a sample log file containing system error messages and analyzed it using common Linux commands such as `cat`, `less`, `tail`, and `grep`.

To better organize and understand the errors, I wrote a Bash (`.sh`) script that processes the log file and summarizes the error information in a readable format.

The main commands used in this project are:

* `grep` for filtering error-related log entries
* `sed` for temporarily cleaning and normalizing error messages to make analysis easier

This project focuses on understanding how log files can be analyzed efficiently in Linux without modifying the original log data.
